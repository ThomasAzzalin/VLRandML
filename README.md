# VLR.gg Data Analysis & Prediction Project
This project scrapes data from the vlr.gg website, stores the information in CSV files, and uses it to train a machine learning model for predicting the outcome of future matches.

## How to Run the Project
To execute the project, run the following scripts in the specified order:
1. dataScraping.py - Collects data from the website and saves it locally.
2. dataset.py - Processes and organizes the scraped data into a structured dataset.
3. MLM.py - Trains and tests the machine learning model based on the prepared dataset.

### Region Selection
Each script will prompt you to input a region. Ensure that the region you select is available in the corresponding project folders for the operations to succeed.
